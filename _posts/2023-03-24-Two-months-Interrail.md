In May 2022, after covid, there was a flash sale of Interrail passes for really very low prices. 
There was a deadline, computers got overloaded, but I managed to get mine via the UK web site.
Only £277 for two months of train travel, without any limit on the number of travel days. 
One had to start using it within a year.

I started using mine on March 24 after the dog sit in Weil am Rhein, to travel from Basel SBB 
back to Växjö.

My next dog sit after that was in Bologna, then St. Cyprien in Dordogne, then Estepona on the 
Costa del Sol, then back home again on May 23. I just made it in time. I think I used about 16 train days.

#### March 24/25: Basel - Hamburg - Copenhagen - Växjö

#### April 4-6: Växjö - Copenhagen - Hamburg - Munich - Verona - Bologna

#### April 16/17: Bologna - Milano - Marseille - Agen - Siorac-en-Périgord

#### May 9-12: Saint Cyprien - Bordeaux - Hendaye - San Sebastián - Madrid - Granada - Málaga 

#### May 20-23: Málaga - Barcelona - Portbou - Narbonne - Avignon - Valence - Grenoble - Geneva - Olten - Mannheim - Hamburg - Copenhagen - Växjö

It would probably have cost me less money to take the plane home. The journey would certainly have been less cumbersome and
arduous.

First problem was to get a ticket. In Spain, one cannot do that online it seems. One needs to go to a railway station. Well,
in Estepona the nearest Renfe station was in Algeciras (across the bay from Gibraltar). It was also difficult to buy tickets for 
the bus. It could not be done the day before. One needed to be there early. When I came there, the express bus was sold out, so 
I had taken the slow bus that made lots and lots of detours to buy a train ticket.

On May 20, I was in time to get a ticket for the express bus to Málaga. And in Málaga I had time to walk around a bit before 
the departure of the train to Barcelona. Although I was in a quiet carriage, there were two elderly women giggling like school 
girls. The conductor came, but they just could not stop. Probably they had known eachother since childhood.

In Barcelona, I took a room in the hotel at the railway station. I walked to the Ramblas and had dinner there.

Next morning to the French border. There is a change of railway gauge, and it seems there is a short distance with parallel tracks.
It was very unclear whether one should get out at Portbou or continue to Cerbère. Everybody got out at Portbou, so I did too. 
Everybody was waiting on the platform for the French train, but it did not come. The Spanish employees said that they did not
have information. It was clearly not their job to tell us about the French trains. Then people found out that there was yet another
railway strike in France. It affected half the trains! So that made it impossible for me to reach my connections in time.

I got off the train at Narbonne, continued by TER to Avignon from there the Valence. Then the last train to Grenoble. 
So that was a change of plan: I would try to get through Switzerland to Hamburg instead. With the first train in the morning 
to Geneva. It was not worth it to take a hotel for a few hours. I got some take-out food, ate it around 1 am, then walked around 
the city or sat by the river until the station opened in the morning.

I got a treain to Geneva, then a Swiss thrain to Olten. From there a direct train to Hamburg. Well, also that was a problem.
