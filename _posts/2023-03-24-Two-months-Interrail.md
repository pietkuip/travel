In May 2022, after covid, there was a flash sale of Interrail passes for really very low prices. 
There was a deadline, computers got overloaded, but I managed to get mine via the UK web site.
Only £277 for two months of train travel, without any limit on the number of travel days. 
One had to start using it within a year.

I started using mine on March 24 after the dog sit in Weil am Rhein, to travel from Basel SBB 
back to Växjö.

My next dog sit after that was in Bologna, then St. Cyprien in Dordogne, then Estepona on the 
Costa del Sol, then back home again on May 23. I just made it in time.
