I had invested 30 € in a retractable tape leash from _flexi_ along with an 8 € holder for the poop bags. The tape was neon-orange 
fluorescent so that I would be prepared for sits with dark and rainy evening walks. As a cyclist I really hated those invisible
leashes from pedestrians to almost-invisible black dogs. Milo in Geneva had a retractable leash and I thought that it might 
it make easier to walk Tahoe. Indeed it did. No more that the leash got caught behind branches on the ground or that it 
would get wrapped around me.

So on Sunday morning I started along the irrigation canal towards the North, without a real plan on how far we would get.
