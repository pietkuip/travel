### Wednesday

This was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I saw late on Sunday evening that someone's booked sitter in Copenhagen had fallen
ill with Covid and that they needed a replacement at short notice. I red the description and I thought that it would be easy 
for me to help out. So that was how om Wednesday morning I came to take the Öresund train directly to Copenhagen's Østerport 
station. Then a short metro ride to the sit.

It was a nice one-bedroom apartment, between Østerbrogade and the large green area of Fælledparken, so very convenient for 
walking a dog. It was a greyhound called Nessie, not a monster by any means but very calm, very easy on the leash. She stays 
by the foot. One hardly feels her, there is just the weight of half of a short leash.
