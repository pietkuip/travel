### Sunday: train Geneva - Lyon - Avignon

After a last dog walk and final cleaning, I cycled to the Geneva railway station.
The trains to France leave from a remote corner, so it was good that I had arrived a bit 
early. On this train, cycles were supposed to be hanging.

Then in Lyon, the next train was a double-decker train, with less height above those
hooks. My recumbent did not fit. So I put it in a space for luggage, prams, etc. 
I suppose I was lucky that no conductor appeared, because the train was quite full.

I arrived after dark in Avignon and I checked in at the Ibis hotel right next door. 
They could store my bicycle in a conference room. It was a bit late, but they could still
serve me a pizza.

### Monday: Avignon, cycling via Sorgues to Pernes

The next day, I explored Avignon. I had been there decades ago, during the theatre
festival. There were crowds then, and free performances on the streets. Now it was more 
quiet.

It was a bit random, and I climbed up on some staircases. That way I got to a park, Jardin
des Doms, I had a cup of coffee there. There is a nice view of the Rh√¥ne and of the famous
bridge.

I was a bit surprised to see a statue there from 1998, dedicated by the maire in the 
presence of "His Royal Highness prince Jean of France representing the count of Paris".
I thought that France was thoroughly republican. This was on the occasion of a thousand
years of Capets! 

Then I cycled to Pernes-les-Fontaines, trying to follow cycling routes. First along an 
irrigation canal (Canal de Vaucluse) through suburbs, then along a railway line to Sorgues
where I had lunch. From there to Pernes-les-Fontaines. It was mostly flat (except the 
occasional viaducts). The sit was easy to find.
