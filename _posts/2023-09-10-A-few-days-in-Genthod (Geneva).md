### Wednesday

The owners had changed their flight a few hours. I was expected around lunchtime instead
of around 9 am. This gave me time for more sleep, breakfast, and some cycling.
First I took the train from Morges to Gland. From there I cycled in beautiful weather
to Genthod, with views of Lake Geneva.

After the children (also twins, I think, just as in Groningen) had some lunch, the family
left for the airport, which is almost next door, and I was left with the sweet dachshund
Milo.
