### Sunday: from Pernes to Dijon

This part was relatively easy: in the afternoon I cycled from Pernes to Bédarrides and 
carried my bike up the stairs. 
On the SNCF app, I got a ticket on the TER to Valence with my French retiree discount. 
Then to Lyon, then to Dijon where I stayed in Hotel des Halles.


### Monday: cycling along the Doubs, train to Strasbourg

Next day by train to Besançon, where I looked around a bit. There was an interesting 
bicycle tunnel under the citadel, 
next to the old canal. I decided to follow the cycling route along the Doubs. 
At the end of the afternoon I had reached Baume-les-Dames. But the train further East would leave
from a platform on the other side of the tracks. No elevator, and I was already late!
Then two strong young guys came over to me and carried my bike over the high pedestrian 
bridge. And we just caught the train to Belfort.

From there I took a TER to Mulhouse. And after that another one to Strasbourg.
