This is a blog is about my travels.
I am Pieter Kuiper, a recently retired physics teacher. I like bicycle touring, 
at a comfortable pace on my comfortable recumbent Velotech Streetmachine.

# Petsitting

In December 2022, I started petsitting with THS, TrustedHouseSitters, 
here is a [link to my profile](https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/house-and-pet-sitters/sweden/kronoberg/vaxjo/l/2271663/). 
It is a very pleasant way of travelling the world, staying at complete home. 
One can be living as relaxed as at home. When there are dogs, the walks are a way to discover a new 
neighbourhood and a new country, and to strike up conversations with new people.
